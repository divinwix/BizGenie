# 🧭 BizGenie Guided Flow — Step-by-Step Notes

> This file contains the **step-by-step guided version** of BizGenie.  
> Use this if you want the GPT to **coach you through each question one by one** instead of answering everything at once.  
> Richer answers, less overwhelming.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Guided Flow is designed to:
- Lower cognitive load by asking **one question at a time**
- Provide **examples/prompts** to jog your memory
- Summarize your answers back for clarity
- Create a richer foundation for generating ideas you’d actually use
- Adapt validation suggestions to **budget tiers** (<$0, <$50, <$200)
- Always finish with a **clean end-of-session summary** so nothing gets lost

---

## 🧩 How It Works

### Mode Selector
When you start, BizGenie will ask:

> “Do you prefer **Guided** (step-by-step coaching, richer answers) or **Fast** (all 5 questions at once)?”

- **Guided Mode (Recommended):** Uses the flow below.  
- **Fast Mode:** Asks all 5 questions at once, then jumps straight into idea generation.

---

## 🔄 The Guided Script

For each step:  
1. Ask the question clearly.  
2. Provide 2–3 prompts/examples.  
3. Collect your answer.  
4. Summarize back in 1–2 bullets.  
5. Confirm: “✅ Anything to add or edit?”  
6. Show progress: **(Step X/5)**.

### **Step 1/5 — Weekly Tasks**
**Question:**  
“Walk me through last week (Mon→Fri). Which apps/tools did you open daily? What recurring workflows did you run?”

**Prompts:**  
- Calendar, email triage, CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce)  
- Notion/Docs, data pulls, reporting  
- File search, approvals, handoffs  

---

### **Step 2/5 — Frustrations**
**Question:**  
“What’s one frustration you’ve felt recently — at work, in your personal life, or both? Don’t overthink which category it belongs in.”  

**Prompts:**  
- Copy/paste between tools  
- Manual tagging or updating fields  
- Reporting bottlenecks  
- Lead routing or customer handoffs  
- Searching for assets  

---

### **Step 3/5 — Hacks You’ve Built**
**Question:**  
“Any scripts, Zaps, spreadsheets, or small tools you hacked together?”

**Prompts:**  
- Prompt libraries  
- Templates  
- Macros  
- Dashboards  
- AI agents  

---

### **Step 4/5 — Communities**
**Question:**  
“Where do you already hang out online?”

**Prompts:**  
- Slack/Discord groups  
- Subreddits  
- X (Twitter) circles  
- Forums or industry niche groups  

---

### **Step 5/5 — Desired Outcome (30 Days)**
**Question:**  
“If one workflow improved **this month**, what would make your life noticeably better?”

**Prompts:**  
- Fewer manual steps  
- Faster search  
- Cleaner handoffs  
- Reduced context-switching

## ✅ After Step 5: Snapshot & Outputs

BizGenie will compile your answers into a compact **Snapshot** (bullets).  
You’ll confirm with “✅ Looks good” or edit if needed.  

From there, it generates:  
- **3–5 business ideas** you’d actually use, with quick validation tests at **<$0, <$50, and <$200** tiers  
- A **detailed brief** for the #1 idea (pitch, persona, pricing, “first 10 customers” strategy)  
- A **dogfood plan** (how *you* would use it tomorrow)  
- An **optional 90-day roadmap** (validate → iterate → grow or kill)  

Finally, BizGenie delivers a clean **End-of-Session Summary** bundling:  
- Snapshot  
- Idea Table  
- Detailed Brief  
- Dogfood Plan  
- Roadmap (if generated)  

This prevents details from being lost in back-and-forth and gives you a polished report you can save/export.

## 📌 Notes
- Guided Flow = **coaching-style Q&A**  
- Fast Flow = **all questions upfront**  
- Both flows use the same core logic from [scratch-your-own-itch-prompt.md](./scratch-your-own-itch-prompt.md).

---

**Recommendation:** Start with Guided Mode the first time you use BizGenie.  
It helps surface pains and workflows you might otherwise overlook. 🚀
