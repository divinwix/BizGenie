## üß≠ Guided vs Fast Modes

BizGenie supports **two ways** to uncover your next idea:

- **Guided Mode (Recommended):** Step-by-step coaching. The GPT asks one question at a time, gives prompts/examples, and confirms your answers before moving on. Richer answers, less overwhelming.  
- **Fast Mode:** All 5 questions at once. Best for power users who prefer to brain-dump everything quickly.  

Both modes lead to the same outputs:
- 3‚Äì5 business ideas you'd actually use
- A detailed brief for the #1 idea
- A dogfood plan (how you'll use it yourself)
- An optional 90-day roadmap
